## Installation
First, download Node.js to simulate JavaScript code outside of the browser. Second, apply the command "npm init" to create your package.json file. We will then manually add the type module in the package.json file. Lastly , we will execute the command npm i inquirer to install the inquirer dependency. The index.js and generateMarkdown.js should have code provided for you to execute.

## Usage
Utilize the index.js file to create your README.md file that you wish to create. Follow and answer the prompts as you go along.
