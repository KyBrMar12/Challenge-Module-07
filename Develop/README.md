## Installation
💽 
First, assuming you have download "Node.js" in order to simulate JavaScript code outside of the browser, apply the command "npm init" to create your package.json file. We will then manually add the type: "module" in the package.json file. Second , we will execute the command "npm i inquirer" to install the inquirer dependency. The index.js and generateMarkdown.js should have code provided for you to execute.


## Usage
🖱️ 
Use the "node index" or "node index.js" command in the terminal to create your README.md file that you wish to create. The npm start command will automatically start it. Follow and answer the prompts as you go along.
